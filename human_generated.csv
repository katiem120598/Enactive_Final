Wright, a prominent advocate of fossil fuel development and a pioneer of the American shale revolution, aligns closely with Trump’s vision of achieving U.S. ""energy dominance"" in global markets. Known for his vocal opposition to climate change initiatives, Wright promotes increased fossil fuel production as a means of alleviating global poverty. If confirmed, he will replace Jennifer Granholm, who championed renewable energy and electric vehicles during her tenure. The Department of Energy under Wright would likely focus on boosting oil and gas production, including lifting restrictions on natural gas exports and replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In addition to his fossil fuel expertise, Wright has experience in nuclear, solar, and geothermal energy, suggesting a multifaceted understanding of energy technologies. His leadership will also extend to managing the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and overseeing national energy labs."

He will help run grant and loan programs and will be replacing Jennifer Granholm who by contrast was a proponent of carbon-free energy. Wright who is against fighting climate change could take quick actions to permit natural gas export approvals and to promote fossil fuel production which he thinks could lift people out of poverty around the globe."

Wrights opinion on fossil fuels and climate change does raise some questions but his track record is undeniable. It is also to be seen that Wright was one of the pioneers of American Shale Revolution that helped America become energy independent. Although fossil fuel production has helped people lift out of poverty its effects on climate change should not be ignored. Wrights policies may help the petroleum industry but also will cause problems in the future. While Chris Wright may be a worthy candidate for the post certain things should be kept in check.

Wright's pro fossil fuel stance surely improve traditional energy industries. "
